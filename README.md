This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Project Goal
This is a simple one page app with a single function, to search for and filter a list of races based on user input.

The page uses react with a static data file.

## Tutorial
This project was created using Andrew Farmer's @ahfarmer's ebook called "Your First React App".  I was hesitant to purchase the book, but it saved me hours of time and presents a step by step project design task list that made this the easiest react app I've created so far.
